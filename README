This is my development fork of pip, the Python package installer- see the
official site ( http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/contributing.html)
for more on it.

I haven't done much yet, but the reason I decided to get involved and start
writing code for pip was so that I could fix a few annoying problems related 
to the "build" temp folders created by pip.

Namely, if pip fails for whatever reason, the temp folder (which is created
in the current working directory) will not be deleted. I decided I could fix
this by first moving build to a temporary directory (using tempfile), and
second ensuring it was always deleted.

I'm looking at making a handful of other tweaks as well, such as moving the
pip configuration from ~/.pip to ~/.config/pip.
