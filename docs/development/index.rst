Development
===========

pip, as an open-source project, welcomes contributions of all forms. The
sections below will help you get started with development, testing, and
documentation.

Please contribute issues, submit bug reports, file feature requests, and help
triage the issues on our issue tracker on `GitHub`_. If submitting a bug report
for the first time, check out `"What to put in your bug report"`_ for guidance.

You can also join ``#pypa`` (general packaging discussion and user support) and
``#pypa-dev`` (discussion about development of packaging tools) `on Freenode`_,
or the `pypa-dev mailing list`_, to ask questions or get involved.
