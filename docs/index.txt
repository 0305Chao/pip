pip
===

pip is a tool for installing and managing Python packages, such as those
found in the `Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_.

pip is a replacement for `easy_install
<http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall>`_.  It mostly
uses the same techniques for finding packages, so packages that are
easy_installable should be pip-installable as well.  This means that
you can use ``pip install SomePackage`` instead of ``easy_install
SomePackage``.

In order to use pip, you must first install `setuptools
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools>`_ or `distribute
<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/distribute>`_.  If you use `virtualenv
<http://www.virtualenv.org>`_, a copy of pip will be automatically be
installed in each virtual environment you create.

Community
---------

The homepage for pip is at `pip-installer.org <http://www.pip-installer.org/>`_.
Bugs can be filed in the `pip issue tracker
<https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/>`_.  Discussion happens on the
`virtualenv email group
<http://groups.google.com/group/python-virtualenv?hl=en>`_.

Bundles
-------

Another way to distribute a set of libraries is a bundle format (specific to
pip).  This format is not stable at this time (there simply hasn't been
any feedback, nor a great deal of thought).  A bundle file contains all the
source for your package, and you can have pip install them all together.
Once you have the bundle file further network access won't be necessary.  To
build a bundle file, do::

    $ pip bundle MyApp.pybundle MyApp

(Using a `requirements file`_ would be wise.)  Then someone else can get the
file ``MyApp.pybundle`` and run::

    $ pip install MyApp.pybundle

This is *not* a binary format.  This only packages source.  If you have binary
packages, then the person who installs the files will have to have a compiler,
any necessary headers installed, etc.  Binary packages are hard, this is
relatively easy.
