Changed rules on where pip version lock file selfcheck.json is stored.

Previously, the lock file was either stored at ``USER_CACHE``/selfcheck.json,
or for vitual enviorments it is stored at ``sys.prefix``\pip-selfcheck.json

Now regardless of whether the user is in a virtual environment, the lock file
is stored either in selfcheck.json in the path specified in cache-dir in
pip.conf, or if none is specified it is stored at``USER_CACHE``/selfcheck.json
